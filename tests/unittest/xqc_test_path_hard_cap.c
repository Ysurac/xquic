 * PR3 Chunk 1: validates the three-stage xqc_path_create() refactor.
 *
 * Stage 1 (validate) must short-circuit BEFORE heavy allocation when the
 * path_id is out of range, abandoned, or lacks an unused CID. The previous
 * single-stage implementation would xqc_calloc() the path_ctx and call
 * xqc_pn_ctl_create() before discovering the missing CID, leaving state
 * (and in this fixture: dereferencing NULL conn->conn_pool) on the table.
 *
 * Stage 2 (defensive hard cap) is exercised by test_path_create_hard_cap_stress
 * — enabled in PR3 Chunk 2 / Task 2.5 once XQC_PATH_HARD_CAP is the sole
 * defensive ceiling and the legacy XQC_MAX_PATHS_COUNT=8 has been removed.
